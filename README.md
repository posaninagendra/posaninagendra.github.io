# Nagendra's Personal Webpage

Hi, I'm Nagendra Posani. I love building something on my own. I'm a tech enthusiastic person. I always want to have a website of my own, but never got enough time to create one. I first thought to use predefined template to make it more fancy but I love doing minimalistic design, so I decided to use black, white and shades of gray to build the webpage. It is a very simple webpage which is filled with my resume data. I want to learn more and try to make more fancy and beautiful with minimalistic design in future. 
Your inputs are always welcomed, please feel free to contact me for any suggestions or to discuss. 

Thanks, <br />
Nagendra Posani.
