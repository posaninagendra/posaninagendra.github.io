I served as iOS Developer at [Kuliza Technologies](https://kuliza.com), in Bangalore for 1.7 years. During this period I worked on various projects and repeatedly recognized for my performance in developing complex mobile applications for multimillion-dollar clients. I am responsible for full lifecycle development of iOS mobile applications, from initial requirement gathering to architecture design, coding, dev-testing, and shipping it to App Store. I have developed about 12 iPhone and 2 Apple Watch applications to various clients, which are deployed on App Store, few of them got more than a million downloads.

Working at Kuliza helped me in developing client-facing skills, I have participated in proposals and presentations on how to model the application to solve the client problems. I received Best Developer awards for my innovative approaches used to solve complex problems. I got a chance to mentor few interns during my tenure, which helped in developing mentorship skills like planning various events to teach them various aspects of app development through tech talks, hackathons, code reviewing, sprint discussions etc.
