Hey there! I'm Nagendra Posani pursuing Masters at [Georgia Tech](https://gatech.edu), Atlanta.

I think, study and work in two major fields: Software Development and Information Security.

I am not afraid of making mistakes and I believe studying is not a period in your life, but a life-forming activity.

I enjoy working on cool projects that challenge me and involve learning new technologies or developing strategies to solve the problem. I have experience in software development. I worked on various [projects]({{site.baseurl}}projects), some of them are developing iOS mobile applications, writing python tools and open source contribution. Few of these projects are published in conferences and invited for talks.

I would love to work on open source projects, if you have any untouched problem statements, let's talk we can work on the project. Currently, I'm contributing in writing the iOS library for Elastic Search with [AppBase](https://appbase.io).

I like problem-solving, programming, cooking, social volunteering and cycling.

If you have any opportunities, please [contact](mailto:nagendra@gatech.edu) me.

Thanks for reading!
