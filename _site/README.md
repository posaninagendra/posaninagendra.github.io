# Nagendra Posani's Website

I used static website generator technology jekyll to develop this website. The theme I used is Hyde which is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
