      <description>Authentication and Authorization are the two fundamentals of security that we are dealing today. With rapid increase of the usage of computers, cell phones and other smart devices like tablets, smart watches and other IoT devices, applications authenticating its users on various devices has become a crucial problem. Also, now-a-days many companies are coming up with multiple related yet independent software products and authenticating their users on each of these applications and granting authorization access to the resources has become a challenging problem.</description>

      <title>Multicasting in Delay Tolerant Networks</title>

      <description>Delay tolerant networks are named so since the connections between nodes are intermittent and hence lack instantaneous end-to-end sender-to-receiver paths. This is particularly applicable to systems that suffer disruption in infrastructure leading to huge delays in message delivery. There can be many real-life applications of delay tolerant networking like emergency response, military systems, vehicular systems and deep-space communication.
In such scenarios, there is no network infrastructure to establish an end-to-end communication path between two nodes.</description>
