      <description>Delay tolerant networks are named so since the connections between nodes are intermittent and hence lack instantaneous end-to-end sender-to-receiver paths. This is particularly applicable to systems that suffer disruption in infrastructure leading to huge delays in message delivery. There can be many real-life applications of delay tolerant networking like emergency response, military systems, vehicular systems and deep-space communication.
In such scenarios, there is no network infrastructure to establish an end-to-end communication path between two nodes.</description>
